## C# Learnings

Throughout the development process of "Monster Showdown," I've acquired valuable knowledge in the following areas:

- Utilizing C# programming language to implement game mechanics, AI behavior, and user interface functionality.
- Applying design patterns like the observer pattern and singleton pattern to improve code organization, enhance modularity, and facilitate communication between different game systems.
- Developing a settings menu UI that allows players to adjust mouse sensitivity and save/load these settings at any time, providing a personalized gameplay experience.
